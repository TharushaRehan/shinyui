# Shiny UI

Shiny UI is a collection of reusable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps. It primarily features components, blocks, and templates geared towards creating landing pages and user-facing marketing materials.

This library is heavily inspired by [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [magicui](https://magicui.design).
